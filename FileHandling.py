'''The number of files that can be simultaneously opened by a program is limited. So it is very important to close all the files, once the operations are completed.'''

'''Sometimes, we may encounter exceptions when dealing with files.
In this example, we are trying to write to a file which is opened in read-only mode. This will result in an exception.
In such a case, letâ€™s see how we can use try except block to catch this exception.'''

try:
    flight_file=open("flight.txt","r")
    text=flight_file.read()
    print(text)
    flight_file.write(",Good Morning")
    flight_file.close()
except:
    print("Error occurred")
    if flight_file.closed:
        print("File is closed")
    else:
        print("File is open")
'''When we want to write a code that will run in all situations, we can put it in a finally block.
Since closing a file is necessary we can do it in the finally block instead of in the try block.'''

try:
    flight_file=open("flight.txt","r")
    text=flight_file.read()
    print(text)
    flight_file.write(",Good Morning")
except:
    print("Error occurred")
finally:
    print("File is being closed")
    flight_file.close()
    if flight_file.closed:
        print("File is closed")
    else:
        print("File is open")
#copy and explore
try:
    hello_file=open("flight.txt","w")

finally:
    hello_file.close()
try:
    hello_file=open("flight.txt","r")
